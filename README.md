The MATLAB and Python scripts that interact with the user and return the (weighted) final grade and the corresponding letter grade is shown below.

### Note
*streamAudio.py* is written by **Zach Miller**.</br>
The code is taken from https://github.com/ZWMiller</br>
I did not ask Zach for permission for uploading his *streamAudio.py* to my own github. The reason for me to upload it here (instead of pointing directly to Zach's repository) is that my students are just beginners in Python so it is very hard for them to go to Zach's account and find the project there. If Zach contacts me for removing the code, I will do it immediately.
